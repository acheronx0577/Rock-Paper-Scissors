## What Makes This Special? ✨

While the game mechanics of Rock Paper Scissors are simple, the real technical achievement here is the **animated RGB background** which is extremely difficult to implement correctly. Unlike static backgrounds or simple transitions, this background:

- Features a smooth, continuously shifting gradient that never repeats the same pattern
- Uses advanced CSS keyframe animations with multiple color stops
- Creates a professional, polished visual experience that rivals modern web applications
- Maintains performance without causing lag or visual glitches
- Provides a visually engaging experience that enhances the simple game mechanics

2. Click on either 🪨 Rock, 📄 Paper, or ✂️ Scissors to make your choice
3. The computer will randomly select its choice
4. Watch the smooth animations as the result is revealed
